Hi! I'm Alireza. I am a first-year Ph.D. student of [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), where I am a member of the [Security and Privacy Lab](https://splab.cis.upenn.edu/).

I'm interested in applied cryptography, with a focus on designing and realizing efficient proof systems for secure computation.

Before joining Upenn, I earned a master's degree in Secure communication and cryptography from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/) where I worked with [Dr. Taraneh Eghlidos](https://sharif.edu/~teghlidos/). I received my Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering (with a Computer science minor) from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir/).
