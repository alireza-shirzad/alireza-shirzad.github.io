Excited to share that I’m joining Lagrange Labs this summer as a research intern! I’ll be working with [Charalampos Papamanthou](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/cpap/)  and [Dimitrios Papadopoulos](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~dipapado/)  on cutting-edge proof systems for AI applications.

Grateful to [Ismael Hishon-Rezaizadeh ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/i20h) for the opportunity.

Looking forward to the journey ahead!
